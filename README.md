# MCR-multiple-experiments
Matlab code for a hard modeling Multivariate Curve Resolution approach fitting multiple experiments at different temperatures and initial concentrations to a kinetic model.

Please download the Matlab Script (MCR_multiple_experiments.m) and example data (input_1.mat, etc.) and run the script.
The example data includes 4 experiments at 4 different temperatures. Changes can be made regarding the temperature, Initial educt concentration and catalyst concentration.
Please follow the documentation in the script when conducting changes.
